## GENTYR Framework

This project uses the GENTYR automation framework.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually construct setup.sh commands or grep for GENTYR scripts. Instead:
- To install, uninstall, reinstall, protect, unprotect, scaffold, or check status: call the `gentyr_setup` MCP tool (from setup-helper server). It generates the correct command with all flags and paths.
- To view or change automation frequencies/intervals/schedules: call `list_automation_config` then `set_automation_mode` MCP tools (from deputy-cto server).

### Agent Selection Guide

Choose the correct sub-agent based on what KIND of work needs to be done. Each agent has a specific domain — using the wrong agent produces worse results.

| Agent | `subagent_type` | Use when... | NEVER use for... |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **INVESTIGATOR** | `investigator` | Researching a problem, understanding root cause, planning approach. Read-only — does NOT edit code. | Writing or editing any files |
| **CODE-WRITER** | `code-writer` | Writing or editing **production source code** (application logic, configs, scripts, types). | Editing test files, reviewing code |
| **TEST-WRITER** | `test-writer` | Writing, editing, or fixing **test files** (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `__tests__/`). Also updating tests after production code changes. | Writing production code |
| **CODE-REVIEWER** | `code-reviewer` | Reviewing all changes for quality, spec compliance, security. Commits code. | Writing production code or tests |
| **PROJECT-MANAGER** | `project-manager` | Syncing documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md), repo cleanup, file organization. | Writing code or tests |

**Critical**: Match the agent to the FILE TYPE being edited:
- Editing `src/**/*.ts` (production code) → **code-writer**
- Editing `__tests__/**/*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` (test files) → **test-writer**
- Editing `*.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (docs) → **project-manager**
- Need to understand a problem first → **investigator**
- Reviewing/committing completed work → **code-reviewer**

### Standard Development Workflow

For **new features or significant changes**, follow this full sequence:

1. **INVESTIGATOR** `Task(subagent_type='investigator')` - Research the task, understand codebase context, plan approach
2. **CODE-WRITER** `Task(subagent_type='code-writer')` - Implement production code changes
3. **TEST-WRITER** `Task(subagent_type='test-writer')` - Add/update tests for the changes
4. **CODE-REVIEWER** `Task(subagent_type='code-reviewer')` - Review all changes, validate spec compliance, commit
5. **PROJECT-MANAGER** `Task(subagent_type='project-manager')` - Sync documentation, repo cleanup (ALWAYS LAST)
6. **SUMMARY** - Report findings to deputy-cto via `mcp__agent-reports__report_to_deputy_cto`

For **scoped work** (e.g., only tests need fixing, only docs need updating), you may start at the appropriate agent and continue the sequence from there. Examples:
- Test files broken after a schema change → start at **test-writer**, then code-reviewer, project-manager
- Only documentation is outdated → start at **project-manager**
- Bug investigation needed → start at **investigator**, then follow full sequence

If a later agent discovers work that belongs to an earlier agent (e.g., test-writer finds a production bug), stop and spawn the correct agent for that work before continuing.

### Golden Rules

- **Match agent to work type** - The test-writer writes tests. The code-writer writes production code. Never cross these boundaries.
- **Follow order for the agents you use** - INVESTIGATOR → CODE-WRITER → TEST-WRITER → CODE-REVIEWER → PROJECT-MANAGER. You can skip earlier agents if their work isn't needed, but never reorder.
- **One agent per role** - Do not combine roles. The code-writer does NOT review. The code-reviewer does NOT write production code. The code-writer does NOT edit test files.
- **Use sub-agents via Task tool** - Each `Task(subagent_type='...')` loads the agent's specialized config from `.claude/agents/`. Never skip this by doing the work directly.
- **Use MCP tools** - Coordinate via `mcp__todo-db__*` for task tracking, `mcp__agent-reports__*` for CTO reporting.

### CTO Reporting

After completing work, report significant findings to the deputy-CTO:
- Use `mcp__agent-reports__report_to_deputy_cto` for issues, discoveries, or status updates
- Critical/security issues are auto-escalated to CTO
- The deputy-cto triages reports hourly

### CTO-Protected Actions

Some actions require CTO approval via the deputy-cto pipeline:
- Architectural changes affecting module boundaries
- Security-sensitive modifications
- Breaking changes to APIs or contracts
- Changes below the `<!-- CTO-PROTECTED -->` divider in CLAUDE.md

### Deployment Flow

`feature branch` → `preview` → `staging` → `production`

Each stage has automated validation. Feedback agents test staging changes automatically.
